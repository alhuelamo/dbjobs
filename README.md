> A Databricks Job Manager

[Databricks CLI](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/cli/jobs-cli.html) is a very useful tool to deal with a Databricks workspace. From there we can start existing jobs [easily](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/cli/jobs-cli.html#run-a-job). However, if we want to stop active executions for a particular job, we need query for their runs —their IDs— first, and then cancel them. This is the main motivation for this tiny CLI app.

It has basically two commands:
- Start an existing Databricks job given its job ID.
- Stop active runs for a particular job given its job ID.
